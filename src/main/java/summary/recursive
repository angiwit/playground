The basic of recursive is that the problem can be divided into smaller problems, e.g. A big number in
Febbinaci can be divided to two smaller numbers, smaller number is smaller problem.
The second precondition is the state should be clear, e.g. stock is not easy to calculate via recursive,
since the big problem has relation with the divided smaller problems, which is the big problem's profit
depends on small problem's buy in price.
